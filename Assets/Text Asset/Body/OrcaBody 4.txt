Orcas use "trains" to locate animals by using phonic lips to create rapid directional clicks that pass through their melon (the rounded part of the orca's forehead). The melon serves as a lens that focuses the "train" into a beam that projects the sound wave forward into an object and then bounces off of that object back to the lower jaw of the orca. The sound wave travels to major areas of sound reception due to its fat filled cavities by starting  from lower jaw to middle ear to inner ear, then to the brain's auditory nerve
