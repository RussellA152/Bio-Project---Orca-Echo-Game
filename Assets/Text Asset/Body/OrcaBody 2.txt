Orcas perform echolocation by producing certain sounds that allow for navigation and communication underwater.
These sounds can help orcas locate food sources and other orcas in areas of dark water+Orcas can produce sounds through clicks, pulsed calls, and jaw claps.
Clicks primarily used for navigation in dark areas.
Whistles and calls are mostly used for social interaction.
