Echolocation allows orcas to be able to coordinate hunting efforts even in the darkness or in certain underwater environments such as hiding in between rocks and coral. They can sense the movements of prey and their size as well. They can also sense the presence of other animals and predators
Ex. A lonely seal gets close to a group of orcas that would then give a signal or call to the other members of the group to carry out a coordinated attack
